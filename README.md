# hello-world
Just learning
I'm a student and I will always be, I'll take it seriously from now on.
I know Java,html and css and I want to learn:
Python,
SQL,
C and variants,
Kotlin,
Node.js
I wanna do this so I can create programs that are useful or entertaining either for me or the public.
My main goal is to achieve mixing programming with biology and chemistry which I really like.
